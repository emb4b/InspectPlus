// getPendingRecords, which buckets pending_delete rows into the push
// payload's `deleted` array) — this is the only local mutation needed to
// trigger it. The row keeps existing locally with this syncState until a
// later pull reconciles it via applyPulledChanges' softDeleteMany; callers
// must filter out pending_delete/deletedAt rows from any list/detail query
// in the meantime (see useEstablishment.ts).
//
// A report that was never pushed (still 'pending_create') has no remote
// counterpart to soft-delete — marking it 'pending_delete' would just send
// its bare id in the push payload's `deleted` array (a no-op remote
// update), while its still-pending purpose_of_inspection and compliance_*
// rows kept trying to INSERT against a report_id that will never exist
// server-side, permanently failing every future push with a foreign key
// violation. For that case, hard-delete the report and everything it owns
// instead — there's nothing to reconcile with the server.
